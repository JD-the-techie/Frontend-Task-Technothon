# Frontend Product Listing UI

## Project Overview
This project is a frontend product listing user interface developed using HTML and CSS as part of the Technothon Frontend Assignment.  
The main objective of the project is to design a clean, responsive, and user-friendly UI to display product information.

## UI Approach and Layout Decisions
- A card-based layout is used to display each product clearly.
- Each product card contains an image, product name, category, and price.
- CSS Grid is used to create a responsive layout that adapts automatically to different screen sizes.
- The design focuses on simplicity, proper spacing, and readability.
- A subtle hover effect is added to improve user interaction without making the UI cluttered.

## Responsiveness
- The UI works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- CSS Grid adjusts the number of columns based on screen width.
- The layout remains clean and usable on smaller screens.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (CSS Grid)
- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub
- Vercel (for deployment)

## Assumptions Made
- Product data is static and used only for UI demonstration.
- No backend or API integration is required as per assignment instructions.
- The focus is strictly on frontend UI design and responsiveness.

## Live Demo
The project is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed using the live link provided in the submission.
